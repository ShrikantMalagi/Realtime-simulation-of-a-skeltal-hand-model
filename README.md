# Realtime-simulation-of-a-skeltal-hand-model

* This project uses the mediapipes to detect hand and to get the coordinates of the landmark points
* The Assets folder contains the .cs file which has the code to run the visual studio code
* The scenes folder contains the model of human hand


#### To Run the simulation 

* open the unity studio and load the script and hand model
* run the unity which acts as a client and requests for the landmark points
* open the python script an run which acts as a server and provides the scaled landmark points 


### The model in the unity studio
